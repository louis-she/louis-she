### Some things I have built in recent years ..

**[Blog](https://chenglu.me/)**

For casually writing .

**[MineTorch](https://github.com/louis-she/minetorch)**

Stuck with me through all those Kaggle competitions, scored 1 gold and 7 silvers. Miss the good old days when even a single 1080 Ti could handle Kaggle just fine.

**[Soundfont Forge](https://soundfont-forge.com/)**

Parse SoundFont file to a bunch of MP3 files, completely done in the browser.

**[gradio-log](https://github.com/louis-she/gradio-log)**

Dynamically display any log files on the fly in Gradio.
